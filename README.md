# Stock-Portfolio-Tracker


Today’s financial markets have slowly become volatile, allowing individual investors to face the challenge of monitoring their portfolios and forecasting future trends across multiple stocks. While financial institutions have access to professional analytical tools, most individual investors rely on fragmented data sources and lack clear insights into performance trends or potential price movements. Highly volatile markets allow investors to become emotional and lead to mishaps in decision-making, resulting in poor trading choices. An automated, data-driven system can remove this bias, which we aim to produce.  

This project aims to design a Python-based stock portfolio tracker and prediction system that allows users to:
 • Monitor real-time and historical portfolio performance.
 • Analyze individual stock metrics such as returns, volatility, and correlations.
 • Predict short-term stock trends using machine learning models.
